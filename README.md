# Python-Webscraper-for-Houzz.com
A webscraper I made for a client using Python and tkinter

This project is made solely to test my self-reliability to do a project on my own and to learn a language on my own.

What I learned from doing this project:
- I learned about Python syntax
- I learned about classes and functions
- I learned about tkinter
- I learned about automation
